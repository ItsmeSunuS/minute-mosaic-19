# Project Title:Track Your Time With Me ✨

Imagine having a tool that helps you gain insights into how you spend your day.The Track Your Time With Me is a modern web application designed to help users track daily activities and visualize time usage with ease and allows them to log their daily activities (e.g., Work, Study, Sleep, Exercise) along with track time spent on each.Users can create an account, log in securely, and record their daily activities along with the time spent on each one. The system ensures that the total time recorded does not exceed 24 hours (1440 minutes).All data is stored in a Firebase Realtime Database using REST API calls, making the app lightweight and easy to deploy.

Key features include:
* User authentication via Firebase (Email/Password or Google login)
* Activity logging with categories and duration (up to 1440 minutes per day)
* Data visualization via interactive pie charts
* Responsive Ui for both desktop and mobile devices
* Data is stored securely in Firebase Realtime Database using REST API calls, ensuring seamless and lightweight operation.
  This tool is ideal for users who want to optimize their time management or simply understand where their hours are going each day.
